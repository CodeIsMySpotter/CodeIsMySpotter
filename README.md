Hi there 👋

I'm passionate about low-level and system programming, especially in languages like Rust, Zig, and x86 Assembly (NASM). I enjoy exploring the internals of how computers work and pushing performance boundaries in High-Performance Computing (HPC).

On the other side, I also love building reliable and efficient backend systems, mostly with Go.

Always curious, always learning. 🚀
